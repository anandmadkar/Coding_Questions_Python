# Declare and initialize 3 three variable and print the biggest number.

a = 10

b = 30

c = 20


if a > b and a > c :
    print(f"The biggest number is {a}")
elif b > a and b > c :
    print(f"The biggest number is {b}")
else :
    print(f"The biggest number is {c}")


-----------Another method using predefined (max) function ------------------------------

a = 10
b = 5
c = 20

print(max(a,b,c))
