# Write a java program that performs the following tasks.
# a. Store a number in a variable
# b. If value is not in range (100-1000) prints wrong number else follows the steps
# c. Check even or odd
# d. If even divide the number by 3 and print the remainder
# e. If odd divide the number by 2 and print the remainder.
    
Solution ==

num = int(input("Enter a number :"))

remainder = 0

if num in range(100, 1001):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        remainder = num / 3
        print("The given number is Even number")
        print(remainder)
    else:
        remainder = num / 2
        print("The given number is Odd number")
        print(remainder)
else:
    print("It is a wrong number")
